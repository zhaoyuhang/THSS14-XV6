zhou yin ting 
(Verse 1)
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me...
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me...
(Pre-Chorus)
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me, cause
(Chorus)
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been till you put me down
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh oh trouble, trouble, trouble
(Verse 2)
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning...
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, I now I see,I now I see...
(Pre-Chorus)
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me
Hey!
(Chorus)
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been till you put me down
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh oh trouble, trouble, trouble
(Bridge)
When the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her... or anyone... or anything
Yeah
(Chorus)
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been till you put me down
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh oh trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
